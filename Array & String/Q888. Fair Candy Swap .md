# [公平的糖果交换](https://leetcode.cn/problems/fair-candy-swap/)

You are given two integer arrays aliceSizes and bobSizes where aliceSizes[i] is the number of candies of the ith box of candy that Alice has and bobSizes[j] is the number of candies of the jth box of candy that Bob has.

Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy box each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy. The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the number of candies in each box they have.

Return an integer array answer where answer[0] is the number of candies in the box that Alice must exchange, and answer[1] is the number of candies in the box that Bob must exchange. If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.

给定两个不同的数组，交换其中一个数使得两个数组之和相等

## Solution

### 1. 直接计算
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def fairCandySwap(self, aliceSizes, bobSizes):
        """
        :type aliceSizes: List[int]
        :type bobSizes: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # 分别计算A和B的总和 
        a = sum(aliceSizes) 
        b = sum(bobSizes) 
        for i in aliceSizes:
        # 计算出二者之差 如果在B中返回
            diff = (b-a) // 2 + i
            if diff in bobSizes:
                return [i, diff]
```
