# [两个数组间的距离值](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-distance-value-between-two-arrays/)

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d, return the distance value between the two arrays.

The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.

```
Input: arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2
Output: 2
----------
Input: arr1 = [1,4,2,3], arr2 = [-4,-3,6,10,20,30], d = 3
Output: 2
``` 

## Solution 

###
```Python 
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDistanceValue(self, arr1, arr2, d):
        """
        :type arr1: List[int]
        :type arr2: List[int]
        :type d: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # 用arr1的长度 - 所有不满足的情况
        n = len(arr1)
        for i in arr1:
            for j in arr2:
            # 若二者之差小于d则不满足
                if abs(i-j) <= d:
                    n -= 1
                    break
        return n
```
